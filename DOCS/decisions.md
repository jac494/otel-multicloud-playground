# Decision Records

* 2026-01-04: Pinned helm provider to 3.0.2 due to inconsistent plan behavior in previous unpinned latest(?) (I think it was 3.11.1 but I can't find it right this second and closed some of my open search tabs a bit early.)
* 2026-01-04: still ran into more helm provider issues; swapped that out for shell and all is working in DOKS for now. Might be worth revisiting this later, it would be easy to add the chart back in to environments/do/dev
